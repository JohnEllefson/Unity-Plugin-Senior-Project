# Unity-Plugin-Senior-Project
A plugin for the Unity Game Engine (an IDE for creating games) that would be a tool to assist other developers with pathfinding and line of sight AI for NPCs. This plugin will specifically target a grid-based framework and allow developers to alter and tweak certain aspects of the pathfinding and line of sight algorithms that are to be used as part of NPC AI.
